I'm making a game which involves heat and heat management.

Units:
- J: Joules
- m: Meter
- s: Seconds
- kg: Kilogram
- K: Kelvin

Because this is a game, it is assumed that all materials have a dimension of 1m x 1m x 1m. Even if a material is only 1g, it can only occupy 1 tile, so it will have a dimension of 1m x 1m x 1m.
In addition. There is no distance between the materials, and they have a uniform temperature.

In this scenario, there is a cube of hot steel located next to a cube of cold water.

Properties:

Material		Steel	
Heat capacity		490	(J/kg)/K
Thermal conductivity	54	(J/(m*s))/K
Temperature		700	K
Mass			1000	kg

Material		Water	
Heat capacity		4179	(J/kg)/K
Thermal conductivity	0.609	(J/(m*s))/K
Temperature		300	K
Mass			1000	kg


Given the above values, the block of steel has a potential energy of 490*700*1000 = 343 000 000 J
The block of water has a potential energy of 4179*300*1000 = 1 253 700 000 J

The two blocks are next to each other. I'm assuming I can take the geometric mean of the thermal conductivity of both the materials:
Geometric mean of thermal conductivity (GMoTC): sqrt(54*0.609) = 5.734 (J/(m*s))/K

The distance is 1m.

For steel:
- The temperature difference (Tdiff) is -400K
- The heat transfer per second is:
  - GMoTC * Tdiff / distance
  - = 5.734 (J/(m*s))/K * -400K / 1m
  - = -2294 J/s

For water:
- The temperature difference (Tdiff) is 400K
- The heat transfer per second is:
  - GMoTC * Tdiff / distance
  - = 5.734 (J/(m*s))/K * 400K / 1m
  - = 2294 J/s

This means that after 1 second (ignoring that Tdiff changes over time):
- The temperature of the block of steel will have dropped by 2294J, or (J / Heat capacity / mass => 2294/490/1000) 0.0047K
- The temperature of the block of water will have raised by 2294J, or (J / Heat capacity / mass => 2294/4179/1000) 0.0005K
